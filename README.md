# Mentor Match

An algorithm to form mentorship groups between student mentees and mentors.

## Algorithmic Overview
Provided the availability of mentees and mentors, fix a time for a mentor to have a mentorship group based on their availability (phase one), and assign mentees to that mentorship group if it is also in their availability. We let availability denote a collection of one hour timeslots on a specific day.
